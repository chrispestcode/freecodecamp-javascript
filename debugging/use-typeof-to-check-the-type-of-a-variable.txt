/*
You can use typeo f to check the data structure, or type, of a variable. This is useful in debugging when working with multiple data types. If you think you're adding two numbers, but one is actually a string, the results can be unexpected. Type errors can lurk in calculations or function calls. Be careful especially when you're accessing and working with external data in the form of a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object.

Here are some examples using typeo f:

console.log(typeo f ""); // outputs "string"
console.log(typeo f 0); // outputs "number"
console.log(typeo f []); // outputs "object"
console.log(typeo f {}); // outputs "object"
JavaScript recognizes six primitive (immutable) data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, and Symbol (new with ES6) and one type for mutable items: Object. Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.

let seven = 7;
let three = "3";
console.log(seven + three);
// Only change code below this line
console.log(typeof seven);
console.log(typeof three);
